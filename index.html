            <h1>My name is Shawn Tabrizi and I am a full-time engineer living in Berlin.</h1>
            <p>I was born and raised in the heart of the bay area, a breeding pool of technology and innovation. I first
                started programming at the age of 13, trying to learn how to hack my PlayStation Portable so that I
                could
                play free games. Through the PSP hacking community, I learned about the vast potential surrounding
                computers, programming, and the internet.</p>

            <p>I graduated from the <a href="https://ccs.ucsb.edu/">College of Creative Studies</a> at the University of
                California, Santa Barbara studying Physics and Mathematics. I joined Microsoft less than a month later
                to
                work on Microsoft Azure, their cloud computing services.</p>

            <p>I recently joined <a href="https://www.parity.io/">Parity Technologies</a> as a Core Developer working on
                blockchain infrastructure and the future of the decentralized web.</p>

            <p>I am always interested in new adventures, so please feel free to use any of the social links below to
