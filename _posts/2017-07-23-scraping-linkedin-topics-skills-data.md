<p><blockquote>What are the most popular skills among LinkedIn users?
What are the most popular skills among Microsoft employees?
Other top tech companies? (Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc...)
What are the most interconnected skills?</blockquote></p>

<p>These are questions that LinkedIn does not provide a direct answer to. However, through their "<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/directory/topics/">Topics Directory</a>", we should be able to come to these conclusions ourselves!</p>

<p>The Topics Directory seems to be an index over all the different skills that people have put on their profile, alphabetically ordered by skill name. Some pages, like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/topic/azure">Azure</a>, have very specific metadata about the skill, while others like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/topic/azure-active-directory">Azure Active Directory</a>, show up in the directory, but do not have this additional metadata.</p>

<p id="hQGsOdn"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-146 " src="/assets/images/img_59746ae38bf91.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If we look at the additional metadata, you can see that it calls out a number of very interesting data points. It tells you:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>How many people have this skill</li>
 	<li>The top 10 companies that have employees who register this skill</li>
 	<li>(My guess) The top skills that people have who also have this skill</li>
 	<li>(My guess) The top related skills</li>
</ol>

<p>Now clearly, there is some poor Web Design, in that there are two different sections, both with the same title "Top Skills", but contain different data. We will have to do our own interpretation of what this data exactly means, but nonetheless, the data is all useful.</p>

<p>So how do we start scouring this data to answer the questions I proposed at the start of this post? Well, by scraping it of course, and storing it into our own database. Now, this is <a href="https://tech.bragboy.com/2016/11/crawl-all-linkedin-skills.html">not an original idea</a>, but certainly I have not seen anyone collect the level of data which I am interested in. I want to have a copy of all the data points above for each topic, all in a single list!</p>

<h2>So let's do it!</h2>
<p>Of course we will be using <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> + <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">Beautiful Soup</a> + <a href="https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/">Requests</a>. You can find the latest version of my LinkedIn scraper on <a href="https://github.com/shawntabrizi/LinkedIn-Topic-Skill-Analysis">my GitHub</a>. Here, I will only be looking at the main function, which describes the logic of my code, not the specific functions which actually does the scraping. You can find that on <a href="https://github.com/shawntabrizi/LinkedIn-Topic-Skill-Analysis">my GitHub</a>.</p>

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import string
import re
import json

# ...
# sub-functions removed, check GitHub for full source
# ...

def main():
    letters = list(string.ascii_lowercase)
    letters.append('more')
    base_url = "https://www.linkedin.com/directory/topics-"
    for letter in letters:
        letter_url = base_url + letter + "/"
        content = get_content(letter_url)
        for con in content:
            if letter == 'y' or letter == 'z':
                sub_content = content
            else:
                letter_page_url = con.find("a")
                print(letter_page_url)
                if letter_page_url.has_attr('href'):
                    sub_content = get_content(letter_page_url['href'])
                else:
                    sub_content = None
            for sub_con in sub_content:
                topic_url = sub_con.find("a")
                topic = scrape_data(topic_url)
                create_json(topic)
            if letter == 'y' or letter == 'z':
                break
```

<p>To scrape this site, we are basically figuring out the pattern which generates these pages. LinkedIn organizes these topics first by letter, https://www.linkedin.com/directory/topics-{letter}/. Then on each "letter page", they group the topics by alphabetical order, in groups, https://www.linkedin.com/directory/topics-{letter}-{number}/. Finally, if you navigate to the specific topic, you will get the final page with data, https://www.linkedin.com/topic/{topic}.</p>

<p>There are a few exceptions to this pattern, which added complexity to the scraper. Basically the letters Y and Z do not have enough topics to be able to put them in groups, which means instead of navigating 3 pages deep to get the data, we need to navigate only 2 pages deep. You can see I handle this situation in my scraper. Other than that, once I get the data off the page, I put it into a JSON file for later usage!</p>

<p>One thing to note, but that I will not go into detail here about is that LinkedIn actually blocks scrapers in general, by creating a 999 response when you try to get data using a bot. If you want to run this script, you will have to overcome this. If you look online, people mention that you might need to update the user-agent passed in the headers of the web requests, but this did not work for me. I might go into detail about this during another post.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>So, let's look at some of the data. I can import the JSON as an array of dictionaries in Python, and then try and write some queries to get data from it. I am not claiming to write the best or most efficient queries, but hopefully they will get the correct data.</p>

<h3>Loading the data:</h3>

```python
with open(r'C:\Users\shawn\Documents\GitHubVisualStudio\LinkedIn-Topic-Skill-Analysis\results\linkedin_topics_7-23-17.json') as data_file:
    data = json.load(data_file)
```

<h3>How many topics are there total?</h3>

```python
len(data)
```

<pre>33188</pre>
<h3>What are the most popular overall topics/skills?</h3>

```python
ordered_by_count = sorted(data, key=lambda k: k['count'] if isinstance(k['count'],int) else 0, reverse=True)
for skill in ordered_by_count[:20]:
    print(skill['name'])

<p>There is so much more we can do with this data, and I do have plans! I just can't talk about them here. In a related note, I am super excited for the Microsoft Hackathon happening this next week. I will be using these tools, and hopefully more to accomplish an awesome project. Maybe more to share here in the future!</p>
