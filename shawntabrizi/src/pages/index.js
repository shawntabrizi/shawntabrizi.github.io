              <p>I was born and raised in the heart of the bay area, a breeding pool of technology and innovation. I first started programming at the age of 13, trying to learn how to hack my PlayStation Portable so that I could play free games. Through the PSP hacking community, I learned about the vast potential surrounding computers, programming, and the internet.</p>
              <p>I graduated from the <a href='https://ccs.ucsb.edu/'>College of Creative Studies</a> at the University of California, Santa Barbara studying Physics and Mathematics.</p>
              <p>I joined Microsoft less than a month later to work on Microsoft Azure, their cloud computing services.</p>
              <p>I then contributed to <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> as a Lead Developer at Parity Technologies, working on blockchain infrastructure and the future of the decentralized web.</p>
              <p>I now work independently as a <a href="https://github.com/polkadot-fellows">Polkadot Fellow</a>, contributing to and creating open source software.</p>
              <p>I am always interested in new adventures, so please feel free to use any of the social links below to contact me.</p>
