I have had a blog more than once in the past.

At different points in my life, blogging meant different things. The problem with blogging about myself or other personal things is that I find often I do not relate to my past self.

This blog should hopefully be more permanent because I hope to mostly talk about things related to technology, development, and problem solving.

I think the subtitle of my blog is well fitting for the kind of content I hope to have on here. I want to learn, and then teach, all through experience and action.

I hope that you will discover something new along with me.
