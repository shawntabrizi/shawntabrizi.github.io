##### This is a [repost from the Polkadot forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/make-kusama-chaotic-again/11123), where I describe my vision for the Kusama network.

I want to open this forum post as a place for coordination on efforts to bring life and vibes back to the Kusama ecosystem.

## Facts

- Kusama was one of the coolest things to be created in the Polkadot ecosystem.
    - Expect Chaos
    - Cypherpunk / Glitch Vibes: [[ex1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMegZaFfrzI) [[ex2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHPFsPX9iA) [[ex3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDN9ClmGqkc)
    - Pushing the Limits (validators, spammening, parachains, etc...)
- Kusama plays a fundamental role in the security and safety of the Polkadot Network.
- Making Kusama important and relevant for the world is good for Polkadot.
- There are things Kusama can do that Polkadot cannot, both physically and spiritually.

## Hypothesis

- Kusama has died down recently:
    - Polkadot has been really stable recently, causing people to forget how important Kusama is.
    - Kusama lacks a fundamentally unique selling point and feature set.
    - Kusama lacks a fundamentally unique narrative and theme which is independent from Polkadot.

## Potential Solution

Make Kusama Chaotic Again.

- What do we mean by this?

  Let's make Kusama the number one home for the original Cypherpunk movement:

  * Privacy-focused
  * Fully and Truly Decentralized
  * Self-Sovereign
  * Cryptography Pioneers
  * Open, Public Communication
  * Anti-Censorship
  * Technological Transparency
  * Activist Mindset
  * Anonymity Valuing
  * DIY Ethos
  * Freedom-Preserving

- How can we do this?

    - Bring ZK primitives to Kusama.
        - Support low-level host functions to execute ZK functions fast and efficiently.
        - Expose such functions through the upcoming Kusama Hub contracts platform.
        - Maybe a community seeded ["Trusted Setup Ceremony"](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/on-chain-trusted-setup-ceremony/)
    - Experiment with better / more resilient forms of on-chain randomness generation.
    - Create a home for Privacy.
        - Privacy Preserving Stablecoin: Kash
        - Privacy Creating Services (will remain unnamed)
        - Privacy Preserving Voting Systems
    - Post-Quantum Signatures and Experiments
    - Create a Kusama community manifesto and vision
        - Be the Web3 Cloud for the ["Dark Renaissance"](https://github.com/darkrenaissance):
          - [DarkFi](https://github.com/darkrenaissance/darkfi)
          - ZCash
          - Monero
          - Prediction Markets
          - True, unapologetic DEXs
          - P2P Markets
          - etc...
      - Enshrine the cypherpunk movement and spirit.
      - Describe how Kusama and Polkadot differ, yet are still important for one another.
      - Ensure that Kusama treasury allocates and funds projects in this nature.
  - What else? Comment in this thread.

## Action Items

Such a future does not create itself. We must create alignment and a community of people who will steward this future forward.

- Discussion: Are there enough people aligned within the Kusama community to this narrative?
- Formation: Who is willing to step up to lead such efforts, and create groups for people to work together on this?
- Adoption: Who can represent the Kusama technology stack to other like-minded projects and individuals who may want to participate?
- Execution: How can we reclaim access to the Kusama treasury, and allocate funds for this specifically? Start with a bounty?
