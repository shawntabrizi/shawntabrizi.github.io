##### In this post, I will share the video and slides I presented at the Substrate Developer Conference (Sub0) which gives a deep dive into the storage layers of the Substrate blockchain development framework.

This last week I was given the opportunity to present at the official Substrate Developer Conference where I gave a deep dive into the inner workings of Substrate storage.

As a runtime developer, you should know that storage is one of the most important things to keep in mind when designing and developing your new runtime modules. Having a deep understanding of how the different storage layers work and interact will be critical for you to make correct decisions moving forward.

Here is a video of my presentation, and the presentation itself:
